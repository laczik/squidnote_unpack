Program to extract individual notes from a SquidNote backup archive

   Run "squidnote_unpack -h" for usage information

Version 1.0.0 (2023-05-22)
Copyright (c) 2023, ZJ Laczik    

N.B. The extracted files are only meant to be used as input to squidnote2xopp
and are not intended to be loaded by SquidNote, and so they have not been tested
for that use case.
